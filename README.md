## Welcome to the smartmoneyapp

### Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to view our smartmoneyapp. This portfolio project was created by Abdurahman Mohamud, Dandre Opperman, Ibrahim Ahmed, Joshua Roper, Justin Hill and Mark Harrison during a 2 week-long sprint (30-09-2024 to 11-10-2024) for our [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com) full stack software developer boot camp. Each member's contact details are listed at the bottom.

The purpose of this application is to make saving money easier. It achieves this by tracking expenses and visualising trends in personal spending habits. This project intended to mimic the building of a real-world web application, which gets information from the backend API which was also created during the two-week sprint. The backend API can be found here https://github.com/DandreOpperman/smart-money-backend. During the creation of this application, we utilised the following skills:

- Dart
- Flutter
- Documentation
- Trello
- Figma
- Morning standup meetings
- Hosting using Firebase
